# Maturity model for full stack engineers

> From the [Fintan Engineering Guide for Service Development](https://fintan.jp/?p=869)

> Creative service development requires a development team that is autonomously organized. This means that the team members need to choose the methods that are best for them and take the initiative to increase the value they add to the service.
>
> To accomplish this, the composition of the service development team should ideally represent a functional cross-section, and the team members should collectively be able to cover the skills required for full stack engineering. In particular, each team member must have T-shaped skills and continuously master skill sets that are needed. 

When development team members need to master full stack skills with a functional cross section for service development, you need indexes indicating which skills they need to master and how much they need to improve those skills. 

When team members merely focus vaguely on improving the skills they are good at or specific skills are repeatedly focused on when assigning work, team members may become specialists in their particular areas, but this will not necessarily turn them into engineers whose skills have a functional cross section. 

To build full stack skills with a functional cross section, it is necessary to  check and conduct an assessment of the areas where engineers need to improve their skills and the extent to which they need to improve, and train them systematically. 

Our maturity model for full stack engineers provides indexes that define the areas that personnel need to learn and the rank or levels that they need to reach in order to become full stack engineers.

> Note: Definitions of each area, rank and level are provided in the "Maturity model for full stack engineers", which can be downloaded from the links at the bottom of this page.

Our maturity model for full stack engineers is intended for engineers to assess their current skills and create strategies to improve their skills in the areas where they lack the necessary skills to be a full stack engineer, or for leaders to use as part of their measures to assess engineers.


## How to use this document

Skills need to be assessed repeatedly as engineers undergo training or work on service development after previous assessments of their skills. 

Below is an outline of how to use this document.

* Refer to the "Maturity model for full stack engineers", assess the current level of the engineer in each area and give the engineer a rank based on their overall level. 
* Create strategies about the areas where the engineer needs to improve their skills or work they need to be assigned in future based on the results. 
* Carry out service development.
* Regularly review the engineer's current skill level using the "Maturity model for full stack engineers", assigning the engineer a rank as a full stack engineer each time.
* Create strategies for future training and service development each time.

The "Maturity model for full stack engineers" does not contain specific information, such as information on particular products or services. Take into account the technical elements and background relevant to your organization or team when using this to assess engineersâ€™ skills.
